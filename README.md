# Optional Command Line Arguments
-i: a file path to a text file containing the data

-d: the damping factor (float between 0 and 1)

-k: number of data points per class to use as seeds

-t: type of seed selection to use, “random” or “degree”

-e: the epsilon threshold, or squared difference of ⃗rt and ⃗rt+1 to determine conver- gence

-g: value of gamma for the pairwise RBF affinity kernel

-o: a file path to an output file, where the predicted labels will be written
